USE:
        - This program is used to compress the average file and then uncompress that same exact file.
        - There are two programs for this file:
		- encode:
			- This encodes a file to a smaller size with keeping the file basically the same.
			-Arguments:
				- *This argument has to be present or the program won't run,* -i: Inserts a file into the program to encode it to a smaller file.
				- *Optional*-o: Puts the output of the encoded program into a file. By default, this will be oFile.
				- -v: Prints out statistics about the exact file.			
	
		- decode:
			- This decodes that same file.
			- Arguments:
				- *This argument has to be present or the program won't run,* -i: Inserts the encoded file given by encode into the program to decode it to the original file.
				- *Optional*-o: Puts the output of the encoded program into a file. By default, this will be oFile.
COMPILE:
        - Use the Makefile:
                - make all
                        - Will create an executable program called "encode" and "decode".
                - make encode
                        - Creates exectuable as decode.		
		- make decode
			- Creates exectuable as decode.
                - make clean
                        - Will clean all the object files and program file.
